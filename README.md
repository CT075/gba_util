## A GBA data processing library

This library hopes to provide bindings and data structures for manipulating
data for the Nintendo GBA.

## Getting Started

Add the following to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
gba = { git = "https://github.com/CT075/gba_util.git" }
```

and import with `extern crate`:

```rust
extern crate gba;

// use gba::
```

This library is currently in-progress.
